		<p style="color: white; background-color: #095082"> The Social Network is one of my all time favourite movies which never gets bored even after infinite times of rewatching. This film is directed by renowned and my personal favourite director David Fincher. This film stars Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake in main roles. It's a semi-fictional adaptation of how the great social media platform Facebook is found. I personally like Andrew Garfield as an actor which is one of the reasons why I watched this film. At first it felt like a normal film. But after a re-watch the film just became a masterpiece to me.<br><br><hr>

		<p style="color: white; background-color: #095082">On a fall night in 2003, Harvard undergrad and computer programming genius Mark Zuckerberg sits down at his computer and heatedly begins working on a new idea. In a fury of blogging and programming, what begins in his dorm room soon becomes a global social network and a revolution in communication. A mere six years and 500 million friends later, Mark Zuckerberg is the youngest billionaire in history... but for this entrepreneur, success leads to both personal and legal complications.â€”Columbia Pictures</p>
